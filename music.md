Some of the music projects I have going on right now.<br />
## Kimera

Kimera is a rock band that plays primarily rock covers from the 60s until now at bars and coffee shops all around the Northern Louisiana area. I play keys and sing backup and occasionally lead. You can check out our [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/KimeraTheBand/) page to see if we're playing anywhere any time soon!

## Solo stuff
Over the years, I've tried my hand at songwriting and composition. I would definitely love to spin this into a bigger deal and record an ep or something, but for right now I don't have the time or resources, so I'll have to be content with just a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCchHQ4vJrun1sexJ_ol5Q7w?) where I post the very occasional cover or original song I've written. 

#### Sleepy time stuff
I've also got a **very** experimental [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk3QAEowGoHcgaUAjDZcCgQ) where I am trying out a more sort of atmospheric type of composition along with storytelling. This project is sort-of on hiatus right now until I have more time to dedicate to music in general.

## Music Stuff
I've been passionate about music for as long as I remember. With a Dad like I had, who was a music teacher that had a nightly jam session on our upright piano at home, it was hard not to be. I have been in jazz bands and orchestras and choirs and rock bands since I was in 5th Grade, and I hope I'll continue to be for a long time. <br /> 

[Here's](/misc/music) a collection of some of the music projects I have going on right now.

## Video Game Stuff
I spent the Summer of 2018 in Rochester, NY freelancing, rock climbing, and having entirely too much free time. Since I'd always been interested in playing video games (raised a Nintendo fanboy, but these days more of an indie fella), I decided to learn how to make games using the [Unity game engine](https://unity3d.com/). I participated in a few game jams, where you make games over a **very** short period of time. You can find some of the games I've made [here.](/misc/games/)

## Fitness-related Stuff
When I was a kid, I was **always** involved in one sport or another. In fact, I ended up running track (the 100m, 200m, and 400m) at Louisiana Tech for my Freshman and Sophomore years. <br />

I'm always up for a game of pickup anything really or hiking or rock climbing or anything interesting really. HMU if you're tryna go outside and sweat a little bit.

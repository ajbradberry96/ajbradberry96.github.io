Hello!<br />

My name is Andrew Bradberry and I am a Senior Cyber Engineering student at Louisiana Tech University, due for graduation this upcoming May.<br />

Currently, I am seeking a full-time Software Engineering position, ideally in the realm of Data Science. I am fascinated with all things related to machine learning, and am very excited about the opportunity to apply all the things I've learned at a professional level. However, I'm a sucker for any project with interesting people doing interesting things, so I'd also be happy to do anything as long as I can find an environment like that! <br />

I have several personal projects in various states of completion you can find [here](../Projects/). If you're looking for some other interesting things about me, you can check out other fun things going on in my life [here](../misc).

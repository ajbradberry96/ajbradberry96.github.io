Hello!<br />

My name is Andrew Bradberry, and I am a Senior Cyber Engineering student at Louisiana Tech University with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics, due for graduation this upcoming May.<br />

Currently, I am seeking a full-time Software Engineering position. I'm a sucker for any project with interesting people doing interesting things, so I'd be happy work anywhere as long as I can find an environment like that! I have extensive experience working with Python and Java, as well as exposure to C#, C++, C, Lua, SQL, and etc.<br />

My personal projects have tended to be in the realm of Data Science lately. I am fascinated with all things related to machine learning, so the opportunity to apply all the things I've learned at a professional level is particularly exciting.<br />

I have several personal projects in various states of completion you can find [here](../projects/).<br />

 If you're looking for some other interesting things about me, you can check out other fun things going on in my life [here](../misc).

Hello!<br />

My name is Andrew Bradberry, and I am a Software Engineer with Sila SG in Shelton, CT, with experience in Data Science, Research, and Software Development.<br />

Currently, I am seeking a full-time Software Engineering position. I'm a sucker for any project with interesting people doing interesting things, so I'd be happy work anywhere as long as I can find an environment like that! I have extensive experience working with Python and Java, as well as exposure to C#, C++, C, Lua, SQL, and etc.<br />

My personal projects have tended to be in the realm of Data Science lately. I am fascinated with all things related to machine learning, so the opportunity to apply all the things I've learned at a professional level is particularly exciting.<br />
